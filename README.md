# Hanish Saini

I’m a Computer Science undergraduate focused on **building systems that think, scale, and compound over time**. My work sits at the intersection of **AI, software engineering, and system design**—less about demos, more about foundations.

I’m driven by a long-term ambition: to design intelligent systems that are **useful in the real world**, resilient under constraints, and extensible as technology evolves. I care deeply about *how* things are built, not just *what* they do.

---

## How I Think

* I prefer **depth over surface-level breadth**
* I’m interested in **systems**, not scripts
* I optimize for **learning velocity and long-term leverage**
* I believe good engineering is quiet, precise, and hard to fake

---

## What I’m Exploring

* Large Language Models as **reasoning infrastructure**, not just chat
* Retrieval-augmented systems that respect **accuracy, latency, and cost**
* AI agents that operate with **clear boundaries and intent**
* Data pipelines where **privacy and statistical integrity** actually matter

---

## Technical Foundations

I work primarily with:

* **Python** for backend systems, AI pipelines, and orchestration
* **Modern backend frameworks** (FastAPI, Django, Flask)
* **LLM ecosystems** (RAG, embeddings, vector databases, orchestration layers)
* **Databases & infrastructure** (PostgreSQL, SQLite, AWS)
* **Core CS fundamentals**: data structures, operating systems, networks

Tools change. Principles don’t.

## Selected Work

Rather than a long list, a few projects that reflect how I think:

* **SynthForge** — an exploration into privacy-aware synthetic data generation, balancing statistical fidelity with responsible AI practices
* **AI Document Intelligence Agent** — a study in making complex academic content genuinely queryable, not just searchable
* **ECHO-OS** — an experimental direction around agent-based system orchestration and natural language control

Each project is a vehicle for learning, not an endpoint.

## Background

* B.Tech in Computer Science (IoT)
* Experience building and deploying end-to-end systems independently
* Led technical teams under real-world constraints

I’m comfortable operating without hand-holding and under incomplete information.

---

## What I’m Looking Toward

* Building **AI-first products** with real utility
* Working with people who value **clarity, rigor, and ownership**
* Long-term: contributing to systems that outlast trends
